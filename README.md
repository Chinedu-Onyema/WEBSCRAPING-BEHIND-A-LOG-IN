THIS PROJECT WAS CREATED BY CHINEDU ONYEMA. IN THIS PROJECT I SCRAPED A WEBSITE BEHIND A LOG IN AND LOADED IT INTO A DATABASE.

FULL STORY CAN BE SEEN USING THE LINK

MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAD THE ZIP FOLDER archive (7) ZIP FOLDER to access the JUPYTER NOTEBOOK SAVED AS AN HTML FILE. YOU CAN DOWNLOAD TO VIEW THE HTML FILE IN A CHROME BROWSER. THE PYTHON SCRIPS CAN BE COPIED AND USED IN 'Python Scripts to Scrape and load into a database' to scrape your own data and load it into a database.

THIS PROJECT WAS USED WITH THE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK
